Ways to switch between split terminals in Cursor:

1. **Click** the terminal tab you want to focus.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts** (common):
   - `Ctrl+` ` (backtick)` to focus the terminal panel
   - `Ctrl+PageUp` / `Ctrl+PageDown` to cycle through terminal tabs
   - `Alt+Left/Right Arrow` to move between split panes (if supported)
3. **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):
   - Search for "Terminal: Focus Next Terminal" or "Terminal: Focus Previous Terminal"

If these don't match your setup, check Cursor's keyboard shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+K Cmd+S` on Mac) to open Keyboard Shortcuts
- Search for "terminal" to see all terminal-related shortcuts

You can also right-click a terminal tab to see options like splitting, closing, or renaming terminals.

how to use nu ls but filter for only directories?

Checking your Nushell scripts for examples:


---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: /home/amite/code/python/personal-triage-agent/utils/nu-scripts/dep-check.nu</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: /home/amite/code/python/personal-triage-agent/utils/nu-scripts/example-statistics.nu</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

In Nushell, filter `ls` to show only directories using `where`:

```nu
ls | where type == "dir"
```

Or:

```nu
ls | where type == dir
```

This filters the `ls` output to rows where `type` equals `"dir"`.

You can also use `select` to show only specific columns:

```nu
ls | where type == "dir" | select name
```

Or chain with other operations:

```nu
ls | where type == "dir" | sort-by modified
```

The `type` column in `ls` output can be `"file"`, `"dir"`, `"symlink"`, etc., so filtering by `type == "dir"` returns only directories.
